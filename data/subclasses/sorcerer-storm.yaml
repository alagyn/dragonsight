      You can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts
      of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or
      after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows 
      you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

      Whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or 
      higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts 
      from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you 
      can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage
      (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.

      If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling
      in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.
      If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction
      that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows
      in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter
